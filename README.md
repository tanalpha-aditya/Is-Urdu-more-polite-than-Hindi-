#The Topic

Urdu and objective study on power, prestige and love.

#Purpose

The hate speech detection systems are employed in checking hate speeches on social media sites, so we thought of love speech detection (something which can detect the amount of politeness or sweetness in a sample)
So we thought about languages that are sought to be soothing, and Urdu, according to our hypothesis, is among one of the best examples.

#Hypothesis

In our project, we are aiming to prove that Urdu is one of the softspoken languages or it is comparatively more soothing as compared to Hindi.

#Methodology

We are proposing to take sets of data from Urdu from daily usage/ghazals / shayri / and other renowned sources and then translate it into Hindi. After translation, we will survey those data sets with people who are aware of both languages and ask them about the degree of sootiness or sweet- sounding they are experiencing in both languages and give them a range from 1 â€“ 10, which will show the degree of sootiness in which the lower the score, the lower its degree of sootiness/politeness.
This article focuses on the fact that the beauty or soothingness of the language, specifically Urdu in this case, is lost due to translation. So, our idea is to use the translation method to on texts of Urdu and to check whether soothingness is maintained or not. And if it's not, then it proves that soothingness is not due to the context but rather the language itself.
